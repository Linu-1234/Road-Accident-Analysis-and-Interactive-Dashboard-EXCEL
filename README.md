# Road-Accident-Analysis-and-Interactive-Dashboard-EXCEL

## Project Objective
To analyze road accident data, identify patterns, and provide an interactive dashboard for data visualization, enabling better understanding of accident trends and helping stakeholders make informed decisions.

## Project Overview
- The project involves analyzing road accident data by performing data cleaning, preprocessing, and visualization. 
- The final output is an interactive dashboard that provides insights such as accident trends, casualty types, vehicle involvement, and location-based analysis.
- Clickable icons within the dashboard enhance usability by linking to additional informative resources, including the data sheet, external web pages, and email communication.

## Requirements:

The client required a Road Accident Dashboard for 2021 and 2022 to gain insights into the following:
1. Primary KPIs:
- Total casualties after accidents.
- Total casualties and their percentage based on:
  1. Accident severity (Fatal, Serious, Slight).
  2. Vehicle type involved.
2. Secondary KPIs:
- Total casualties categorized by vehicle type.
3. Maximum casualties based on:
  - Road type (e.g., Single Carriageway, Dual Carriageway).
  - Surface condition (e.g., Dry, Wet, Snow/Ice).
4. Distribution of casualties based on:
  - Area/location (Rural vs. Urban).
  - Time of occurrence (Day/Night).
5. Relationship between casualties and:
  - Location.
  - Time of day (Day/Night).
 
## Tools Used:
- Data Cleaning and Processing: Excel
- Dashboard Creation: Excel Dashboard
- Interactive Features: Hyperlinks for navigation
- Design and Visualization: Logos from Excel

## Process Used:
1. Data Cleaning:
- Checked for null or duplicate values.
- Replaced duplicate values.
2. Data Processing:
- Extracted month and year from the accident date column by using Excel functions, adding two new columns for month and year.
3. Dashboard Creation:
- Integrated timelines for years, months, quarters, and days.
- Designed slicers for filtering data by location (rural/urban).
- Added charts for:
  1. Casualty trends by severity (Fatal, Serious, Slight).
  2. Casualty distribution by vehicle type.
  3. Casualty trends (CY vs PY).
  4. Casualties by road type and surface condition.
  5. Casualties by location (Rural/Urban) and time (Day/Night).
  6. Incorporated interactive logos linking to relevant resources, including:
    - Dashboard page (itself).
    - Data analysis sheet.
    - External webpage about road accidents in India.
    - Personal email for further communication.

8. Monthly Trends:
  - Casualties showed a steady increase from January to December, with peaks in mid-year months.

## Conclusion
- The Road Accident Analysis and Interactive Dashboard project provides a clear, interactive tool for analyzing road accident data.
- By highlighting key patternsâ€”such as casualty types, vehicle involvement, and location-based trends , the dashboard helps stakeholders make informed decisions to improve road safety.
- Interactive features like clickable icons ensure easy access to additional resources, enhancing usability and accessibility.
- The project successfully delivers actionable insights that can contribute to safer roads.
